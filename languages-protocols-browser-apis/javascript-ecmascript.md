# JavaScript (EcmaScript)

**Context: [frontend-dev-bookmarks](../README.md) / Languages, Protocols, Browser APIs**

JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It is defined by ECMAScript standard.
