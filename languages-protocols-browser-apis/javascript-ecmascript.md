# JavaScript (EcmaScript)

**Context: [frontend-dev-bookmarks](../README.md) / Languages, Protocols, Browser APIs**

JavaScript is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It is defined by ECMAScript standard.

Standards are needed for formatting and styling JavaScript code.
+ **Objects**: An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.
    + **[ECMA-262-3 in detail: OOP - The general theory](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-7-1-oop-general-theory/)**: In this article we consider major aspects of object-oriented programming in ECMAScript.

    + **[What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)**: Philip Roberts, in this video, tries to create an intuitive understanding of what happens when JavaScript runs. He talks about the call stack, event loop, callback queue and other concepts.
+ **[Promises](https://www.promisejs.org/)**: The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation.

    + **[MDN page on Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)**: The Promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
    + **[The Promises/A+ Spec](https://promisesaplus.com/)**: An open standard for sound, interoperable JavaScript promises—by implementers, for implementers.
    + **[What is Promise.try, and why does it matter?](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/)**: In this brief article Sven Slootweg provides a better explanation of what Promise.try is, and why you should always use it, without exceptions.
    + **[What's The Point Of Promises?](http://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-is-the-point-of-promises)**: The point of promises is to represent the eventual resulting value from an operation, but the reason to use them is to better parallel synchronous operations and to solve the callback hell.
